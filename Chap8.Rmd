### 2.1 A Smoothing Example

Denote the training data by $\bZ = \{z_1,z_2,\dots,z_n\}$, with $z_i = (x_i,y_i)$, and $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^1$. If we use a B-spline basis expansion with 3 knots placed on the quartiles, we can represent the function by

$$E(Y|X=x) = \mu(x) = \sum_{j=1}^7\beta_jh_j(x)$$

__MSE__

The MSE can be represented by $\hat{\beta} = (\bH^T\bH)^{-1}\bH^T\by$, where $\bH \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times 7}$ with $ij$th elements $h_j(x_i)$. The estimated covariance matrix of $\hat{\beta}$ is $\hat{\text{Var}}(\hat{\beta}) = (\bH^T\bH)^{-1}\hat{\sigma}^2$, where $\hat{\sigma}^2 = \sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - \hat{\mu}(x_i))^2/N$. The standard error of a prediction $\hat{\mu}(x) = h(x)\hat{\beta}$ is $\hat{\text{SE}}[\hat{\mu}(x)] = [h(x)^T(\bH^T\bH)^{-1}h(x)]^{1/2}\hat{\sigma}$. This can be used to construct the confidence interval. 


__Bootstrape Approach__

Nonparametric bootstrap: Draw $B$ datasets each of size $N=50$ with replacement, where the sampling unit is $z_i = (x_i,y_i)$. Using each boostrapped dataset $\bZ^*$, we fit a cubic spline $\hat{\mu}^*(x)$. With large enough resamles, we can use percentiles to get the confidence band.

Parametric bootstrap: simulate new responses by adding GAussian noise to the predicted values (assuming we assume a Gaussian error for the original model). 


### 2.2 MLE

In general parametric bootstrap agree with MLE.

## 3. Baysian Methods

Baysian specifies a sampling model $\text{Pr}(\bZ|\theta)$, and a prior distribution for the parameter $\text{Pr}(\theta)$ representing our knowledge about $\theta$. The goal is to compute the posterior distribution

$$Pr(\theta|\bZ) = \frac{Pr(\bZ|\theta)\cdot Pr(\theta)}{\int Pr(\bZ|\theta)\cdot Pr(\theta) d\theta}$$.

A future observation can be predicted via the predictive distribution

$$Pr(z^{new}|\bZ) = \int Pr(z^{new}|\theta) Pr(\theta|\bZ)d\theta$$

## 7. Bagging

Bootstrap mean is approximately a posterior average, 

Consider training data $\bZ = \{(x_1,y_1),\dots, (x_N,y_N)\}$ and prediction $\hat{f}(x)$ at input $x$. Bagging (bootstrap aggregation) averages this prediction over a collection of bootstrap samples, thereby reducing its variance. For each bootstrap sample $\bZ^{*b}, b = 1...B$, we fit the model and get the prediction $\hat{f}^{*b}(x)$. The bagging estimate is defined by 

$$\hat{f}_{bag}(x) = \frac{1}{B}\sum_{b=1}^B \hat{f}^{*b}(x)$$

For a classification problem with $K$ responses, and the predicted classes $\hat{G}(x)$. For each single prediction, it provides an indicator vector with value a single one and K-1
 zeroes. The the bagged estimation is a K-vector $[p_1(x),p_2(x),..., p_K(x)]$, with $p_k(x)$ equal to the proportion of predicted class $k$ at $x$.
